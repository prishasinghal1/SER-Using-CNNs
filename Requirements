To download the dataset via Kaggle in my Colab notebook, I uploaded Kaggle API credentials (kaggle.json), and the downloaded the dataset using the Kaggle API.
So setup instructions for the Colab notebook to run include: 
- Get Kaggle API credentials from kaggle.com/settings
- Replace 'Enter your username' and 'Enter your API Key' in Cell 2
